## 🧩 Game Logic Overview

- **Tile Spawning System:**  
  New tiles are generated as the player moves forward. When the player passes a certain point, a new tile spawns seamlessly.

- **Coin & Obstacle Logic:**  
  Coins and obstacles are spawned dynamically with logic to prevent impossible combinations.

- **Score System:**  
  Each collected coin increases score, displayed in the UI HUD.

- **Game Manager:**  
  Handles the tile spawning, player respawn, and overall game control.
